# iOSCodeSample
This is the source code of my personal iOS apps from year 2009 to year 2015 shared as open source code. The development technologies include Objective-C, iOS framework, GCD, RESTful API/NSOperation/Threading, Location base API, MAPKit, AWS mobile framework etc. The resources in these projects such as image, text, third party libraries have been removed.

The "BubbleTile" game is implemented on the spiral matrix and zag-zig matrix
